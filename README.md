# General Deep Image Completion
A Deep Image Completion Model for Recovering Various Corrupted Images

# Demo on Windows
We build a simple interactive demonstration of image completion based on Python, OpenCV and TensorFlow on Windows

## Setups
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A source code editor (Optional, but highly recommended)
- Follow the guidelines from [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows) to instal Python 3.5.2 and TensorFlow on Windows
- Install libraries numpy and opencv-python through pip
- Run demo_windows_iccv.py

If you failed to import tensorflow, please refer to [this article](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8385) for possible solutions.
